## Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a full-stack web application for managing agent and customer data. It includes a React.js-based frontend for the user interface, a Node.js/Express.js-based backend for API endpoints, and Supabase as the database for storing and retrieving data.

## Features

- View a list of agents and their details.
- View a list of customers associated with each agent.
- Add, edit, and delete agents and customers.
- Search for agents and customers.
- Pagination for large datasets.

## Technologies

- Frontend:

  - React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - Material-UI: A UI component library for React applications.
  - JavaScript: The programming language used for the frontend logic.

- Backend:

  - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
  - Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
  - JavaScript: The programming language used for the backend logic.

- Database:
